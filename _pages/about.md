# About Me

Qianjun Xia is an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, concentrating on robotics and control. His current research in the Creative Machine Lab, advised by [Jiong Lin](https://jl6017.github.io/) and [Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/), focuses on video-based parameter estimation for deformable objects, combining large-scale simulation with modern video models to infer physical properties from motion.

Before coming to Columbia, Qianjun earned his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where he was advised by [Prof. Dong Wang](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/wangdong1.html). He worked on magnetic-wire-guiding robots for minimally invasive surgery involving mechanical design, control, and elastic–rod modeling.

His broader interests lie in robot learning, physics-based simulation, and data-driven modeling of soft and deformable systems.
