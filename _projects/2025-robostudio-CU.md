This project was completed as part of the MECEE4611 Robotics Studio course in Spring 2025, taught by Prof. Hod Lipson.
Together with Zizai Ma, we developed a bipedal robotic prototype named M.E.H, integrating custom mechanical design, embedded hardware and motion control.

In our collaboration, Zizai Ma led the mechanical design, fabrication, and hardware integration, while I was primarily responsible for control algorithms, gait planning, inverse kinematics, and the overall software architecture.
Through iterative design and testing, our robot achieved a maximum walking speed of approximately 32 cm/s on flat ground, demonstrating the effectiveness of the motion controller under lightweight hardware and low-cost actuation constraints.
