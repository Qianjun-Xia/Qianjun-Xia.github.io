### Overview

This project develops a magnetically controlled vascular interventional guidewire robot and its control software, aimed at reducing surgeons’ X-ray exposure and improving accuracy in minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures. A hard-magnetic guidewire is actuated by an external permanent magnet mounted on an industrial robot, enabling precise bending and navigation inside tortuous blood vessels.

### System Architecture

The full system integrates two subsystems:

- **Manual teleoperation platform**
  - Uses an Xbox wireless controller as a unified input device.
  - One controller simultaneously drives the industrial robot, the guidewire feeding mechanism, and the distal rotary motor.
  - Real-time signal processing strategies ensure low latency and allow human intervention in abnormal situations.

- **Software control platform (PC, Qt/PyQt)**
  - QtDesigner-based GUI with a script editor, console output, camera view, and one-click “macro” buttons.
  - Supports Python scripting of high-level procedures, real-time feedback, and an emergency stop that safely halts all devices via multi-threaded control.
  - Combines the flexibility of manual control with the precision and repeatability of automatic control.

### Large Deformation Modeling of the Guidewire 

To accurately predict the guidewire shape under magnetic actuation, the project builds a **Cosserat-rod-based large deformation model**:
- Models the guidewire as a slender rod undergoing **bending, torsion, stretching, and shear**, overcoming the limitations of constant-curvature and classical Kirchhoff models.
- Discretizes the rod with a finite-difference scheme; derives the coupling between position, orientation, curvature, and internal forces/moments.
- Incorporates the magnetic torque from both uniform fields and a **magnetic dipole field** generated by the external permanent magnet, enabling simulation under realistic spatially varying fields.

These simulations are later tabulated to build a mapping from magnet pose to guidewire tip deflection, serving as the basis for automated path-following control.

### Experimental Validation

A transparent, 3D-printed vascular phantom with multiple bifurcations is used to emulate patient-specific vasculature. The complete system—manual controller, software platform, vision feedback, and magnetic actuation—is evaluated on two key tasks:

1. **Automatic navigation:**  
   The guidewire successfully follows a preset path through complex branches and reaches the target location under autonomous control.

2. **Error detection and correction:**  
   When the guidewire unintentionally enters a wrong branch, the system:
   - detects the deviation via vision,
   - retracts the guidewire to the previous node,
   - updates the expected magnet pose using the theoretical model,
   - and re-advances along the correct path.

### My Contributions

- Designed and implemented the **unified manual control framework** (Xbox controller → PC → robot, feeder, and distal motor), including real-time filtering and signal routing.
- Developed the **Qt/PyQt software platform**, GUI, scripting interface, one-click macros, and multi-threaded emergency stop logic.
- Formulated and implemented the **Cosserat-rod-based large deformation model** for the hard magnetic guidewire, including finite-difference discretization and magnetic loading.
- Conducted experiments in 3D-printed vascular models, integrating vision feedback and control algorithms to demonstrate fully automatic navigation and error correction.
